# Fraud Detection

1. Transaction API
   Current role: Entry point from banks into your system.

Suggestions:

Add input validation + schema registry to ensure transaction data matches expected format. If using Kafka, Confluent Schema Registry + Avro/Protobuf helps avoid downstream errors.

Implement rate limiting or queue buffering to handle bank-side spikes.

Use idempotency keys to prevent duplicate transactions on retries.

2. Kafka
   Current role: Asynchronous event backbone.

Suggestions:

Partition by accountId or customerId to keep transaction ordering per account.

Tune retention period in case fraud detection service goes down temporarily.

Enable DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) for malformed/unprocessable events.

Consider using Kafka Streams or ksqlDB for some simple fraud rules before hitting the main service (reduces load).

3. Fraud Detection Service
   Current role: Consumes Kafka events, detects fraud, writes alerts.

Suggestions:

Make it stateless for scalability, but keep historical patterns in a separate fast DB (like Redis, Cassandra, or PostgreSQL with indexes).

Add circuit breaker and retry policies for downstream DB writes.

Consider real-time feature store (like Redis or Feast) for faster model-based fraud checks.

4. Alert Storage
   Current role: Stores confirmed fraud alerts.

Suggestions:

Use a DB optimized for time-series or analytics (e.g., PostgreSQL + Timescale, ClickHouse, or Elasticsearch).

Keep audit logs immutable for compliance.

Partition by alert date for query performance.

5. Redis Cache
   Current role: Keeps recent fraud metrics for Grafana.

Suggestions:

Consider using Prometheus instead of Redis for metrics, since Grafana integrates seamlessly. Redis can still store hot transactional data for fraud checks.

If Redis is used for both metrics + feature store, keep them in separate logical databases to avoid key collisions.

6. Metrics → Grafana
   Suggestions:

Push from fraud detection service → Prometheus → Grafana (more standard).

Use alerts in Grafana so fraud spikes notify teams instantly.

Track latency metrics (transaction ingestion to alert creation) to detect pipeline slowdowns.

7. Reliability / Observability
   Add a Kafka lag monitoring tool (Burrow, Conduktor, or Prometheus Kafka Exporter) to know if fraud detection service is falling behind.

Centralized logging (e.g., ELK or OpenTelemetry) for tracing transactions through the pipeline.

High availability for Kafka, Redis, and alert DB.
